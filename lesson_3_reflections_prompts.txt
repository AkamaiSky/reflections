When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you have to colaborate with others, or are accessing a repository from different locations / PCs.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because others may make changes to the repository that you are unaware of
    
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A clone is a direct copy of something (local or remote). A fork starts off as a clone of a GitHub Repository but lets you go from there. A branch consists of one or more commits based around new functions etc.

 What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It allows you to work from the most up-to-date remote commit
